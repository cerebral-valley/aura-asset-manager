## Getting Started with Aura

### Understanding Aura's Philosophy

Aura is fundamentally different from traditional financial management applications. Rather than focusing on complex metrics, budgeting, or day-to-day expense tracking, Aura is designed to help you visualize your financial standing and feel secure about the assets you've accumulated over time. The application serves as your personal financial sanctuary—a place where you can reflect on your achievements and feel proud of the foundation you're building for yourself and your loved ones.

The core philosophy behind Aura centers on three key principles. First, every asset you own represents an accomplishment in your life journey. Whether it's your first home, a growing stock portfolio, or a collection of precious metals, each asset tells a story of your hard work and financial discipline. Second, insurance isn't just an expense—it's a protective shield that guards your assets and provides peace of mind. Aura helps you visualize the total value of this protection rather than focusing on premium costs. Third, your financial journey is personal and unique. Aura adapts its language and presentation to match your individual aspirations and comfort level.

### Choosing Your Theme

When you first use Aura, you'll be asked to choose a theme that best represents your financial mindset and aspirations. This choice affects how information is presented throughout the application, ensuring that your experience feels personal and motivating.

The **Sanctuary Builder** theme is perfect for those who prioritize security, peace, and contentment. If you're someone who values stability and wants to build a solid foundation for yourself and your family, this theme presents your assets as components of a growing sanctuary. Your net worth becomes your "Sanctuary Value," and your progress is framed in terms of strengthening your foundation and nurturing your financial garden.

The **Growth Chaser** theme appeals to those who are actively accumulating wealth and excited by the journey of financial growth. This theme presents your financial journey as an adventure or expedition. Your assets become territories you've discovered or peaks you've conquered, and your progress is measured as altitude gained on your financial ascent.

The **Empire Builder** theme is designed for those with ambitious financial goals who think strategically about wealth building. This theme presents your assets as dominions in your growing empire, with each acquisition strengthening your financial kingdom. Your net worth becomes your "Empire Value," and transactions are framed as strategic moves to expand your influence and power.

You can change your theme at any time through your profile settings, allowing you to adapt the application as your financial situation and mindset evolve.

## Navigating the Dashboard

The dashboard serves as the command center of your Aura experience, providing an immediate overview of your complete financial position. When you log into Aura, the dashboard is the first thing you'll see, and it's designed to give you an instant sense of security and accomplishment.

### Understanding Your Core Metrics

The most prominent element on your dashboard is your total net worth, presented using language that matches your chosen theme. This figure represents the combined current value of all your assets and serves as the primary measure of your financial foundation. Unlike traditional financial apps that might show daily fluctuations in red and green, Aura presents this information in a calm, reassuring manner that emphasizes long-term progress rather than short-term volatility.

Alongside your net worth, you'll see your total insurance coverage value. This metric shows the combined protection value of all your insurance policies, helping you understand the strength of your financial safety net. Many people underestimate the value of their insurance coverage, but Aura helps you appreciate this crucial component of your financial security.

The dashboard also includes a growth potential indicator that shows your progress toward financial milestones. This metric helps you understand where you stand on your journey and provides motivation to continue building your financial foundation.

### Asset Allocation Visualization

One of the most powerful features of the dashboard is the asset allocation chart, which provides a visual representation of how your wealth is distributed across different asset classes. Rather than presenting this as a dry pie chart, Aura transforms this information into an engaging visualization that matches your chosen theme.

For Sanctuary Builders, the chart might be presented as different sections of your financial garden, with each asset class represented as a different type of plant or area. Growth Chasers might see their allocation as different territories on an exploration map, while Empire Builders view it as different provinces in their kingdom.

This visualization helps you understand the balance and diversification of your portfolio at a glance. A well-diversified portfolio typically includes a mix of asset classes such as real estate, stocks and investments, precious metals, and liquid cash reserves. The chart makes it easy to see if you're over-concentrated in any particular area and might benefit from rebalancing.

### Recent Milestones

The dashboard includes a feed of your recent financial activities, but rather than calling them "transactions," Aura frames these as "milestones" or "achievements." This section shows your latest asset acquisitions, value updates, and other significant financial events, helping you see the steady progress you're making over time.

Each milestone is presented with context that makes it feel meaningful rather than mundane. Instead of simply showing "Purchased 100 shares of AAPL," Aura might display "Strengthened alliance with Apple Inc." or "Added to technology holdings," depending on your theme preference.

## Managing Your Assets

The Assets section of Aura serves as your comprehensive inventory of everything you own. This is where you can view, add, edit, and organize all your holdings, from real estate and investments to precious metals and cash reserves. Think of it as your financial museum—a place where each asset tells the story of your journey and accomplishments.

### Understanding Asset Categories and Types

Aura organizes assets into several broad categories, each designed to accommodate different types of holdings while maintaining flexibility for unique situations. Each category includes multiple specific asset types to ensure accurate classification and reporting.

**Real Estate Assets**
Real estate represents one of the most significant wealth-building categories for many individuals. Aura supports multiple real estate subcategories:
- **Residential Properties**: Your primary home, vacation properties, rental houses, condominiums, and townhomes
- **Commercial Properties**: Office buildings, retail spaces, warehouses, mixed-use properties
- **Agricultural Land**: Farmland, ranches, orchards, and other agricultural properties
- **Industrial Properties**: Manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, storage facilities
- **Raw Land**: Undeveloped lots, future development sites, recreational land

For each real estate asset, you can track comprehensive details including property address, square footage, lot size, purchase date, original purchase price, current estimated value, rental income potential, property taxes, and maintenance costs. The metadata system allows you to store additional information such as renovation history, zoning details, or special characteristics.

**Investment Assets**
The investment category encompasses all your financial market holdings:
- **Individual Stocks**: Common and preferred shares of publicly traded companies
- **Bonds**: Government bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, treasury bills
- **Mutual Funds**: Actively managed funds across all sectors and asset classes
- **Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)**: Index funds, sector funds, international funds
- **Cryptocurrency**: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital currencies
- **Alternative Investments**: REITs, commodities, private equity, hedge funds
- **Retirement Accounts**: 401(k), IRA, Roth IRA, and other retirement vehicles

For investment assets, you can track ticker symbols, number of shares or units, purchase dates, cost basis, dividend yields, and current market values. Aura automatically calculates unrealized gains/losses and tracks your investment performance over time.

**Precious Metals and Tangible Assets**
Physical assets that hold intrinsic value:
- **Gold**: Coins, bars, jewelry, collectible pieces
- **Silver**: Bullion, coins, industrial silver holdings
- **Platinum and Other Precious Metals**: Investment-grade metals
- **Jewelry**: Valuable personal jewelry, watches, collectible pieces
- **Collectibles**: Art, antiques, rare books, wine collections, memorabilia
- **Vehicles**: Cars, motorcycles, boats, recreational vehicles, classic automobiles

Track weights, purity levels, storage locations, insurance coverage, and current market values. For collectibles, include condition assessments, provenance, and professional appraisals.

**Cash and Cash Equivalents**
Your liquid holdings that provide financial flexibility:
- **Bank Accounts**: Checking, savings, money market accounts
- **Certificates of Deposit**: Fixed-term deposits with guaranteed returns
- **Cash Holdings**: Physical cash, foreign currency holdings
- **Short-term Investments**: Treasury bills, commercial paper, high-grade bonds

**Business and Professional Assets**
Assets related to your professional activities:
- **Business Ownership**: Sole proprietorships, partnerships, corporate shares
- **Professional Equipment**: Tools, machinery, specialized equipment
- **Intellectual Property**: Patents, trademarks, copyrights, royalty streams
- **Business Real Estate**: Properties used in business operations

### Comprehensive Asset Parameters

When adding or editing assets in Aura, you'll work with a comprehensive set of parameters that capture both financial and contextual information about each holding.

**Core Financial Information**
- **Asset Name**: A meaningful, personalized name for your asset
- **Asset Type**: Specific categorization from Aura's extensive asset type taxonomy
- **Purchase Date**: When you acquired the asset
- **Initial Value**: The amount you paid when acquiring the asset
- **Current Value**: The most recent estimated or market value
- **Quantity**: Number of units, shares, or other measurable quantities
- **Unit of Measure**: Shares, ounces, square feet, units, or other relevant measures

**Strategic Asset Classification**
These newer parameters help you understand the strategic role each asset plays in your portfolio:

**Asset Purpose**: This critical field defines why you own this asset and what role it serves in your financial strategy:
- **Growth**: Assets purchased primarily for capital appreciation (e.g., growth stocks, development properties)
- **Income**: Assets that generate regular income (e.g., dividend stocks, rental properties)
- **Capital Preservation**: Assets focused on maintaining purchasing power (e.g., government bonds, precious metals)
- **Speculation**: High-risk, high-reward assets with uncertain outcomes (e.g., cryptocurrency, penny stocks)
- **Hedge**: Assets that protect against specific risks or economic conditions (e.g., inflation-protected securities)
- **Legacy**: Assets intended for long-term wealth transfer (e.g., family heirlooms, trust properties)

**Time Horizon**: This parameter indicates your planned holding period and affects how you should think about the asset:
- **Short-term (0-2 years)**: Assets you plan to sell or use in the near future
- **Medium-term (2-10 years)**: Assets supporting medium-term goals like major purchases
- **Long-term (10+ years)**: Assets for retirement, generational wealth, or long-term objectives

**Liquidity Status**: Understanding how quickly you can convert assets to cash is crucial for financial planning:
- **Liquid Assets**: Can be converted to cash within days (stocks, bonds, bank accounts)
- **Illiquid Assets**: Take months or years to convert (real estate, private equity, collectibles)

This classification helps you understand what portion of your wealth is readily accessible for emergencies or opportunities versus what's locked up in longer-term investments.

**Detailed Asset Descriptions and Metadata**
Use the description field to tell the story of each asset. Instead of technical details, focus on what makes this asset meaningful to you. The metadata system (stored as JSON) can capture asset-specific information like:
- Real Estate: Property details, rental history, improvement records
- Stocks: Sector information, analyst ratings, dividend history
- Collectibles: Condition, provenance, insurance details
- Precious Metals: Purity, storage location, certification details

### Adding New Assets: A Comprehensive Walkthrough

When you acquire a new asset, adding it to Aura should feel like celebrating an achievement. The asset creation process is designed to capture all relevant information while making the experience positive and meaningful.

**Step 1: Choose Asset Category and Type**
Start by selecting the broad category (Real Estate, Investments, etc.), then choose the specific asset type. Aura's extensive taxonomy ensures you can accurately classify virtually any asset type.

**Step 2: Name Your Asset Meaningfully**
Give your asset a name that resonates with you personally. Instead of "AAPL Stock," consider "Technology Growth Portfolio" or "My First Stock Investment." Instead of "123 Main Street," try "The Rental Property" or "Our Family Home."

**Step 3: Define Strategic Parameters**
- **Asset Purpose**: Why did you acquire this asset? What role does it play in your financial strategy?
- **Time Horizon**: How long do you plan to hold this asset?
- **Liquidity Needs**: How quickly could you convert this to cash if needed?

**Step 4: Enter Financial Details**
Record the purchase date, initial cost, current value, and any quantity information. Be as accurate as possible—this information drives all your portfolio calculations and analysis.

**Step 5: Add Context and Story**
Use the description field to capture why this asset is important to you. This might include:
- How you decided to make this purchase
- What you hope to achieve with this asset
- Special circumstances or memories associated with the acquisition
- Future plans or expectations for this holding

**Step 6: Capture Asset-Specific Details**
Use the metadata system to record information specific to your asset type. For real estate, this might include property details and improvement history. For investments, it could include research notes or purchase rationale.

### Asset Performance Tracking and Analysis

Aura provides sophisticated tools for understanding how your assets perform over time, but always with a focus on long-term progress rather than short-term volatility.

**Individual Asset Journeys**
Each asset page tells the complete story of that holding, showing:
- Purchase history and average cost basis
- Current value and unrealized gains/losses
- Transaction history (additional purchases, partial sales, value updates)
- Performance relative to purchase date and market conditions
- Income generated (dividends, rent, interest) if applicable

**Portfolio-Level Analysis**
The Assets dashboard provides comprehensive portfolio-level insights:
- **Asset Allocation Visualization**: See how your wealth is distributed across categories, purposes, and time horizons
- **Liquidity Analysis**: Understand what percentage of your wealth is readily accessible
- **Purpose Alignment**: See whether your asset mix aligns with your stated financial goals
- **Geographic Diversification**: For applicable assets, see geographic spread
- **Risk Distribution**: Understand concentration risks and diversification levels

**Performance Metrics That Matter**
Rather than focusing on daily fluctuations, Aura emphasizes metrics that support long-term financial security:
- **Total Return**: Capital appreciation plus income generated over holding period
- **Compounded Annual Growth Rate**: Smoothed returns that show true long-term performance
- **Risk-Adjusted Returns**: Performance considering the volatility and risk level of each asset
- **Portfolio Contribution**: How each asset contributes to your overall financial picture

### Transaction Types and Asset Updates

Aura supports a comprehensive range of transaction types that capture every aspect of asset ownership and management:

**Purchase Transactions**
Record new asset acquisitions or additions to existing holdings. Include purchase price, fees, and any relevant context about why you made this investment decision.

**Sale Transactions**  
Handle partial or complete asset sales, automatically updating quantities and calculating realized gains/losses. Include sale price, fees, taxes, and context about your decision to sell.

**Value Update Transactions**
Update current market values for assets that don't have daily pricing (like real estate or collectibles). These updates help maintain accurate portfolio valuations without requiring sales.

**Transfer Transactions**
Handle asset movements between accounts, ownership changes, or other administrative updates that don't involve buying or selling.

**Update Quantity/Units**
Adjust asset quantities due to stock splits, dividend reinvestments, or other corporate actions that change the number of units you own without affecting total value.

**Update Description/Properties**
Modify asset descriptions, metadata, or other characteristics when circumstances change (like property improvements or changed investment thesis).

**Income Recording**
Track dividends, rental income, interest payments, and other income generated by your assets. While Aura doesn't focus on income tracking like budgeting apps, recording this information helps paint a complete picture of each asset's contribution.

### Advanced Asset Management Features

For users with extensive portfolios, Aura provides tools for bulk asset management:

- Market conditions or personal circumstances at the time of purchase
- Lessons learned from each asset's performance
- Emotional or family significance of particular holdings

**Strategic Portfolio Construction**
Use Aura's strategic parameters to build a portfolio that aligns with your goals:
- **Purpose Diversification**: Ensure you have assets serving different strategic purposes
- **Time Horizon Balance**: Mix short, medium, and long-term holdings appropriately
- **Liquidity Management**: Maintain adequate liquid assets for emergencies and opportunities
- **Risk Appropriate Distribution**: Balance growth potential with capital preservation needs

**Privacy and Security Considerations**

- **Access Control**: Regularly review who has access to your Aura account and asset information
- **Backup Strategy**: Understand how your asset information is backed up and protected

The goal of asset management in Aura is not to create anxiety about daily performance or constant optimization, but to help you feel confident and secure about the financial foundation you're building. Each asset represents an achievement and a step forward in your financial journey. Take pride in what you've accomplished and use Aura's tools to continue building thoughtfully toward your goals.

### Dashboard Customization

Take time to explore the features, personalize your experience, and most importantly, take a moment to appreciate the financial foundation you're building for yourself and your loved ones.

## Managing Your Assets

The Assets section of Aura serves as your comprehensive inventory of everything you own. This is where you can view, add, edit, and organize all your holdings, from real estate and investments to precious metals and cash reserves.

### Understanding Asset Categories

Aura organizes assets into several broad categories, each designed to accommodate different types of holdings while maintaining flexibility for unique situations.

**Real Estate** assets include any property you own, whether it's your primary residence, rental properties, vacation homes, or land holdings. For each real estate asset, you can track details such as the property address, square footage, purchase date, original purchase price, and current estimated value. The metadata system allows you to store additional information specific to each property, such as renovation details, rental income, or special characteristics.

**Stocks and Investments** encompass publicly traded securities, mutual funds, ETFs, bonds, and other financial instruments. For these assets, you can track the ticker symbol, number of shares or units, purchase dates, cost basis, and current market value. The system accommodates both individual securities and pooled investments like mutual funds.

**Precious Metals** include gold, silver, platinum, and other valuable metals, whether held as coins, bars, jewelry, or other forms. You can track the weight, purity, form factor, and current market value of your precious metal holdings.

**Cash and Cash Equivalents** represent your liquid holdings including bank accounts, money market funds, certificates of deposit, and other easily accessible funds. While these might seem straightforward, tracking them in Aura helps you see how your liquid reserves fit into your overall financial picture.

**Other Assets** category provides flexibility for unique holdings that don't fit neatly into other categories. This might include collectibles, business interests, intellectual property, or any other valuable items you own.

### Adding New Assets

When you acquire a new asset, adding it to Aura is a straightforward process that's designed to feel celebratory rather than administrative. The "Add Asset" function guides you through providing the essential information about your new holding.

Start by selecting the appropriate asset category, which determines what specific fields are available for data entry. Provide a meaningful name for the asset—this is how it will appear throughout Aura, so choose something that resonates with you. For example, instead of just "123 Main Street," you might call it "Our Family Home" or "The Downtown Property."

Enter the key financial details including the purchase date, initial value, and current value if different from the purchase price. For assets with quantities like stocks or precious metals, specify the number of shares, ounces, or other units you own.

The metadata section allows you to store additional information that's specific to your asset type. For real estate, this might include property details like square footage or lot size. For stocks, you might include the exchange or sector information. This additional context helps make your assets feel more tangible and meaningful.

### Tracking Asset Performance

One of Aura's key strengths is helping you track how your assets perform over time without creating anxiety about short-term fluctuations. Each asset page includes a clean, simple view of the asset's journey from acquisition to present day.

The asset detail page shows the complete transaction history for that specific holding, including your original purchase, any additional acquisitions, partial sales, and value updates. This history helps you see the story of your relationship with that asset over time.

Regular value updates are important for maintaining an accurate picture of your net worth. Aura makes it easy to update asset values as market conditions change or as you receive new appraisals. The system tracks these updates over time, allowing you to see how your assets have appreciated or depreciated.

For assets that generate income, such as rental properties or dividend-paying stocks, you can record these benefits as part of the asset's story. While Aura doesn't focus on income tracking like a traditional budgeting app, acknowledging the income-generating capacity of your assets adds to the sense of accomplishment and security.

## Recording Transactions

The Transaction Center serves as the engine room of Aura, where all changes to your asset holdings are recorded and processed. This section is designed to handle the full lifecycle of asset ownership, from initial acquisition through partial sales and final disposition.

### Understanding Transaction Types

Aura recognizes several different types of transactions, each designed to capture a specific type of financial activity while maintaining the positive, achievement-oriented language that characterizes the application.

**Purchase transactions** record when you acquire new assets or add to existing holdings. Whether you're buying your first shares of a stock, purchasing additional gold coins, or acquiring a new property, purchase transactions capture the details of how you're expanding your financial foundation.

**Sale transactions** handle the disposition of assets, whether partial or complete. Aura recognizes that selling assets isn't necessarily a negative event—it might represent strategic rebalancing, profit-taking, or converting one type of asset into another. The system handles partial sales gracefully, automatically updating quantities while maintaining the complete transaction history.

**Value update transactions** allow you to record changes in asset values without actual buying or selling activity. This is particularly important for assets like real estate or collectibles that don't have daily market prices but may be reappraised periodically.

**Transfer transactions** handle situations where assets move between different accounts or forms without a traditional sale. This might include moving stocks between brokerage accounts, converting one type of investment into another, or other administrative changes that affect your holdings.

### The Transaction Process

Recording a transaction in Aura is designed to feel meaningful and positive rather than like mundane data entry. The system guides you through the process with clear prompts and helpful context.

Begin by selecting the type of transaction you want to record. The interface then adapts to show the relevant fields for that transaction type. For purchase transactions, you'll specify the asset being acquired (or select an existing asset if you're adding to current holdings), the quantity purchased, the price per unit, and the total amount spent.

Sale transactions require you to specify which asset you're selling, how much you're disposing of, and the sale price. If you're selling only part of your holdings, Aura automatically calculates the remaining quantity and updates your records accordingly.

Value updates are particularly straightforward—simply select the asset and enter its new current value. Aura records this update with a timestamp, allowing you to track how asset values change over time.

The transaction system also accommodates fees, taxes, and other costs associated with buying and selling assets. While these details might seem mundane, they're important for maintaining accurate records and understanding the true cost basis of your holdings.

### Transaction History and Audit Trail

Every transaction you record in Aura becomes part of an immutable audit trail that provides a complete picture of your financial activities over time. This history serves multiple purposes: it helps you understand your investment patterns, provides documentation for tax purposes, and creates a narrative of your financial journey.

The transaction history is searchable and filterable, allowing you to quickly find specific transactions or analyze patterns in your financial behavior. You can filter by asset type, transaction type, date range, or amount to focus on particular aspects of your financial activity.

Each transaction record includes not just the basic financial details but also any notes you choose to add. These notes can provide context about why you made particular decisions, market conditions at the time, or personal circumstances that influenced the transaction. Over time, these notes create a rich narrative of your financial journey.

## Insurance Management

The Insurance section of Aura represents a fundamental shift in how you think about insurance coverage. Rather than viewing insurance as an expense or necessary evil, Aura helps you appreciate insurance as a powerful protective shield that guards your assets and provides peace of mind.

### Understanding Your Protection Portfolio

Just as you have a portfolio of assets, you also have a portfolio of insurance protection. Aura helps you visualize this protection portfolio and understand how different types of coverage work together to create a comprehensive safety net.

**Life Insurance** provides financial protection for your loved ones in the event of your death. Whether you have term life insurance, whole life insurance, or other types of life coverage, Aura focuses on the benefit amount—the protection value that would be available to your beneficiaries. This perspective helps you appreciate the significant financial security that life insurance provides to your family.

**Health Insurance** protects you from the potentially devastating financial impact of medical expenses. While health insurance is complex with deductibles, co-pays, and coverage limits, Aura focuses on the maximum annual and lifetime benefits, helping you understand the scope of protection you have against medical costs.

**Property Insurance** covers your physical assets including your home, vehicles, and other valuable possessions. Aura tracks the coverage limits for each type of property, helping you see the total value of protection for your physical assets.

**Liability Insurance** protects you from financial claims that others might make against you. This includes the liability portions of your auto and homeowner's insurance, as well as any umbrella liability policies you might have. Understanding your total liability coverage helps you appreciate how well protected you are from potential lawsuits or claims.

### Adding and Managing Policies

When you add an insurance policy to Aura, the focus is on the protection value rather than the cost. While premium information is captured for completeness, the emphasis is on helping you appreciate the security that each policy provides.

For each policy, you'll provide a meaningful name that helps you remember what the policy covers. Instead of just using the insurance company's policy number, you might call it "Family Protection Plan" for life insurance or "Home Guardian Policy" for homeowner's insurance.

The coverage amount is the most important piece of information for each policy. This represents the maximum benefit that the policy would provide, and it's the figure that Aura emphasizes in all displays and calculations. Seeing these coverage amounts clearly helps you understand the true value of your insurance portfolio.

Policy details such as renewal dates, premium amounts, and payment frequency are also tracked, but they're presented as secondary information. Renewal date tracking helps ensure you don't accidentally let important coverage lapse, while premium information provides context for the cost of your protection.

### Visualizing Your Safety Net

One of Aura's most powerful features is its ability to help you visualize the total value of your insurance protection. The dashboard shows your total coverage amount across all policies, often revealing a surprisingly large number that represents the financial security you've built through insurance.

This total protection value is presented alongside your asset value, helping you see both sides of your financial security equation. You have assets that represent what you've built, and you have insurance that protects both those assets and your ability to continue building in the future.

The insurance section also provides breakdowns by coverage type, helping you see how much protection you have in different areas of your life. This visualization can help you identify gaps in coverage or areas where you might be over-insured relative to your actual needs.

## Analytics and Insights

The Analytics section of Aura provides deeper insights into your financial position and progress over time, but always with a focus on building confidence rather than creating anxiety. Unlike traditional financial applications that might emphasize daily volatility or complex performance metrics, Aura's analytics are designed to help you see the big picture and feel good about your progress.

### Portfolio Growth Over Time

The centerpiece of Aura's analytics is a beautiful visualization of how your total net worth has grown over time. This chart shows the steady progress you've made in building your financial foundation, with a visual style that emphasizes the positive trajectory of your journey.

The chart includes markers for significant milestones in your financial journey, such as major asset acquisitions, reaching net worth targets, or other meaningful events. These markers help tell the story of your progress and make the chart feel personal and meaningful rather than just a collection of numbers.

You can adjust the time frame of the chart to see different perspectives on your progress. The default view shows your complete financial journey from when you started using Aura, but you can also focus on recent progress or specific time periods that are meaningful to you.

### Asset Allocation Analysis

The analytics section provides deeper insights into how your assets are allocated across different categories and how this allocation has changed over time. This analysis helps you understand whether your portfolio is becoming more or less diversified and whether your asset allocation aligns with your financial goals.

The allocation analysis goes beyond simple category breakdowns to show trends over time. You might see that you've been gradually increasing your real estate holdings while reducing your cash position, or that your stock investments have grown as a percentage of your total portfolio due to market appreciation.

This information is presented in a way that helps you make informed decisions about future investments and asset allocation without creating pressure to constantly rebalance or optimize your portfolio.

### Protection Coverage Analysis

Just as Aura analyzes your asset portfolio, it also provides insights into your insurance coverage portfolio. This analysis helps you understand how well protected you are across different areas of your life and whether your coverage has kept pace with your growing asset base.

The protection analysis shows your total coverage relative to your total assets, helping you understand whether your insurance protection is adequate for your current financial position. As your assets grow, you may need to increase your insurance coverage to maintain appropriate protection levels.

The system also tracks how your insurance portfolio has evolved over time, showing when you've added new coverage or increased existing policy limits. This historical view helps you see how you've systematically built your protective shield as your assets have grown.

## Customization and Personalization

Aura is designed to adapt to your unique financial situation and personal preferences, ensuring that your experience feels tailored and meaningful rather than generic.

### Theme Customization

As mentioned earlier, you can choose from different themes that affect how information is presented throughout the application. But customization goes beyond just changing labels—your chosen theme influences the entire tone and presentation of your financial information.

You can change your theme at any time through the settings menu, allowing you to adapt the application as your financial situation and mindset evolve. Many users find that their preferred theme changes as they progress in their financial journey, moving from Sanctuary Builder to Growth Chaser to Empire Builder as their confidence and assets grow.

### Personal Asset Names and Notes

One of the most powerful personalization features in Aura is the ability to give meaningful names to your assets and add personal notes about their significance. This transforms your asset list from a dry inventory into a collection of meaningful achievements and memories.

For example, instead of listing "2019 Honda Civic," you might call it "My First New Car" and add a note about how proud you were to buy your first brand-new vehicle. A stock holding might be called "Tech Growth Fund" with a note about your belief in the technology sector's long-term potential.

These personal touches make your financial information feel more meaningful and help reinforce the emotional connection between your assets and your life goals and achievements.

### Dashboard Layout

While Aura's dashboard is designed to provide the most important information prominently, you have some control over how information is organized and displayed. You can choose which metrics are most important to you and adjust the dashboard layout accordingly.

Some users prefer to emphasize their insurance coverage prominently, while others focus primarily on asset growth. The dashboard can be customized to reflect your priorities and the aspects of your financial position that are most important to your sense of security and accomplishment.

This user guide provides a comprehensive overview of Aura's features and philosophy. Remember that Aura is designed to be your financial sanctuary—a place where you can feel proud of your achievements and confident about your future. Take time to explore the features, personalize your experience, and most importantly, take a moment to appreciate the financial foundation you're building for yourself and your loved ones.

## Asset Types Guide

### Understanding Asset Classification

Aura provides a comprehensive asset classification system to help you properly categorize and understand all your holdings. This guide provides detailed information about each asset type, including risk profiles, ideal investment horizons, and liquidity characteristics.

### Real Estate Assets

**Primary Residence**
- **Risk Level**: Low to Moderate
- **Time Horizon**: Long-term (10+ years)
- **Liquidity**: Illiquid
- **Description**: Your main home where you live. Primary residences typically appreciate over time and provide both shelter and equity building. They're considered relatively low-risk but illiquid assets, as selling requires significant time and transaction costs.

**Rental Property**
- **Risk Level**: Moderate
- **Time Horizon**: Long-term (10+ years)
- **Liquidity**: Illiquid
- **Description**: Income-generating properties rented to tenants. Rental properties offer both appreciation potential and regular income streams. They require active management and carry risks related to tenant quality, maintenance, and local market conditions.

**Commercial Property**
- **Risk Level**: Moderate to High
- **Time Horizon**: Long-term (10+ years)
- **Liquidity**: Illiquid
- **Description**: Properties used for business purposes including office buildings, retail spaces, and warehouses. Commercial real estate can offer higher returns than residential but carries increased risk and complexity. Lease terms and business cycles significantly impact value.

**Land/Development**
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Time Horizon**: Variable (5-20+ years)
- **Liquidity**: Very Illiquid
- **Description**: Undeveloped land or properties held for future development. These assets carry high risk due to uncertain appreciation timelines, zoning restrictions, and development costs. They generate no income until developed but can offer substantial long-term returns.

### Financial Instruments

**Individual Stocks**
- **Risk Level**: High (company-specific risk)
- **Time Horizon**: Variable (1-10+ years)
- **Liquidity**: Highly Liquid
- **Description**: Ownership shares in publicly traded companies. Individual stocks offer high growth potential but carry significant volatility and company-specific risks. Best suited for investors who can research companies and tolerate price fluctuations.

**Bonds**
- **Risk Level**: Low to Moderate (varies by issuer)
- **Time Horizon**: Short to Long-term (1-30 years)
- **Liquidity**: Generally Liquid
- **Description**: Debt securities issued by governments or corporations. Bonds provide regular interest income and return of principal at maturity. Government bonds are low-risk, while corporate bonds offer higher yields with increased risk. Interest rate changes affect bond prices inversely.

**Mutual Funds**
- **Risk Level**: Moderate (diversified exposure)
- **Time Horizon**: Medium to Long-term (3-10+ years)
- **Liquidity**: Liquid (daily pricing)
- **Description**: Professionally managed portfolios investing in diversified holdings. Mutual funds provide instant diversification and professional management. They charge management fees and trade once daily at net asset value. Suitable for hands-off investors seeking diversification.

**ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds)**
- **Risk Level**: Moderate (varies by holdings)
- **Time Horizon**: Variable (1-10+ years)
- **Liquidity**: Highly Liquid
- **Description**: Index-tracking funds traded on stock exchanges like individual stocks. ETFs combine mutual fund diversification with stock-like trading flexibility. They typically have lower fees than mutual funds and offer tax efficiency. Ideal for cost-conscious investors seeking diversified exposure.

**Cryptocurrency**
- **Risk Level**: Very High
- **Time Horizon**: Variable (speculative)
- **Liquidity**: Generally Liquid (24/7 markets)
- **Description**: Digital currencies using blockchain technology. Cryptocurrencies offer potential for high returns but experience extreme volatility and regulatory uncertainty. They're speculative assets best limited to a small portfolio percentage for risk-tolerant investors.

**REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts)**
- **Risk Level**: Moderate
- **Time Horizon**: Medium to Long-term (5-10+ years)
- **Liquidity**: Liquid (if publicly traded)
- **Description**: Companies owning income-producing real estate. REITs provide real estate exposure without property management responsibilities. They must distribute 90% of taxable income as dividends, offering regular income. They combine real estate benefits with stock-like liquidity.

**Options/Derivatives**
- **Risk Level**: Very High
- **Time Horizon**: Very Short-term (days to months)
- **Liquidity**: Moderate (varies by contract)
- **Description**: Financial contracts deriving value from underlying assets. Options and derivatives offer leverage and hedging capabilities but can result in total capital loss. They require sophisticated understanding and active management. Suitable only for experienced investors.

**Commodities**
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Time Horizon**: Variable (1-10 years)
- **Liquidity**: Varies by commodity
- **Description**: Raw materials and primary agricultural products including oil, natural gas, grains, and livestock. Commodities provide inflation protection and portfolio diversification but experience significant price volatility based on supply/demand dynamics and global events.

**Private Equity**
- **Risk Level**: Very High
- **Time Horizon**: Very Long-term (7-15 years)
- **Liquidity**: Very Illiquid
- **Description**: Ownership stakes in private companies not traded on public exchanges. Private equity investments are illiquid with capital locked up for extended periods. They offer potential for exceptional returns but carry total loss risk and typically require substantial minimum investments.

### Physical Assets & Collectibles

**Gold**
- **Risk Level**: Moderate (volatility)
- **Time Horizon**: Long-term (5-10+ years)
- **Liquidity**: Moderately Liquid
- **Description**: Precious metal held as coins, bars, or jewelry. Gold serves as inflation hedge and safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty. Physical gold requires secure storage and doesn't generate income, but maintains value across centuries. Storage and insurance costs affect total returns.

**Silver**
- **Risk Level**: Moderate to High
- **Time Horizon**: Medium to Long-term (3-10 years)
- **Liquidity**: Moderately Liquid
- **Description**: Precious metal with both investment and industrial applications. Silver prices are more volatile than gold due to industrial demand fluctuations. It's more affordable than gold for small investors but requires more storage space per dollar value.

**Other Collectibles**
- **Risk Level**: Very High (market dependent)
- **Time Horizon**: Very Long-term (10-20+ years)
- **Liquidity**: Very Illiquid
- **Description**: Art, antiques, rare coins, vintage cars, and other collectible items. These assets require expertise to value and authenticate. They offer no income and carry high transaction costs. Value is subjective and dependent on collector markets and trends.
