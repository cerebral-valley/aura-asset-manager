# Aura Asset Manager - Deployment Guide

This comprehensive guide covers deploying the Aura Asset Manager application to production environments. The application consists of a React frontend and Python FastAPI backend, both of which can be deployed to various cloud platforms and hosting services.

## Deployment Architecture Overview

The Aura application follows a modern three-tier architecture that separates the frontend, backend, and database layers. This separation allows for flexible deployment options and scalability as your user base grows.

The **frontend** is a React single-page application that can be deployed as static files to any web server or content delivery network. The built application consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that can be served efficiently from edge locations worldwide.

The **backend** is a Python FastAPI application that provides RESTful API endpoints for the frontend. It requires a Python runtime environment and can be deployed to any platform that supports Python web applications, including traditional servers, containerized environments, or serverless platforms.

The **database** is PostgreSQL hosted on Supabase, which provides managed database hosting, authentication services, and real-time capabilities. Supabase handles database scaling, backups, and security, reducing the operational overhead of managing your own database infrastructure.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure you have completed all necessary preparation steps to guarantee a smooth deployment process and optimal application performance.

### Environment Configuration

Verify that all environment variables are properly configured for production use. This includes updating database connection strings, API keys, and security tokens to use production values rather than development placeholders.

For the backend, ensure that the `ENVIRONMENT` variable is set to "production" to enable production optimizations such as reduced logging verbosity and enhanced security measures. Update the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to include your production frontend domain rather than localhost addresses.

For the frontend, update the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to point to your production backend API endpoint. Ensure that Supabase configuration variables point to your production Supabase project rather than development instances.

### Security Hardening

Production deployments require additional security considerations beyond development environments. Generate strong, unique secret keys for JWT token signing and ensure they are stored securely using your deployment platform's secret management capabilities.

Review and update CORS settings to only allow requests from your legitimate frontend domains. Remove any development-specific origins from the allowed origins list to prevent unauthorized access to your API.

Ensure that all sensitive configuration values are stored as environment variables or in secure secret management systems rather than being hardcoded in your application files.

### Database Migration

If you're migrating from a development database to a production database, plan the migration process carefully to avoid data loss or service interruptions. Export any test data that you want to preserve and ensure that your production database schema matches your application requirements.

Verify that all database indexes are properly created and that row-level security policies are correctly configured to protect user data in a multi-tenant environment.

### Performance Optimization

Before deployment, optimize your application for production performance. For the frontend, ensure that the build process includes minification, tree-shaking, and other optimizations that reduce bundle size and improve loading times.

For the backend, review database queries for efficiency and ensure that appropriate caching strategies are in place for frequently accessed data. Consider implementing connection pooling for database connections to handle concurrent user requests efficiently.

## Frontend Deployment

The React frontend can be deployed to various hosting platforms, each with different advantages depending on your specific needs and requirements.

### Static Site Hosting

Since the React application builds to static files, it can be deployed to any static site hosting service. Popular options include Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3 with CloudFront, and GitHub Pages.

**Netlify Deployment**: Netlify provides an excellent platform for React applications with automatic deployments from Git repositories. Connect your repository to Netlify, configure the build command as `pnpm run build` and the publish directory as `dist`. Netlify will automatically build and deploy your application whenever you push changes to your repository.

Configure environment variables in the Netlify dashboard under Site Settings > Environment Variables. Add all the `VITE_` prefixed variables that your application requires, using your production values.

**Vercel Deployment**: Vercel offers similar functionality to Netlify with excellent performance and developer experience. Import your project from your Git repository, and Vercel will automatically detect that it's a React application and configure appropriate build settings.

Set environment variables in the Vercel dashboard under Settings > Environment Variables. Ensure that all variables are configured for the Production environment.

**AWS S3 and CloudFront**: For more control over your hosting infrastructure, you can deploy to AWS S3 with CloudFront for global content delivery. Build your application locally using `pnpm run build`, then upload the contents of the `dist` directory to an S3 bucket configured for static website hosting.

Configure CloudFront to serve your S3 bucket content with appropriate caching headers and SSL certificates for secure HTTPS access.

### Custom Domain Configuration

Regardless of which hosting platform you choose, you'll likely want to configure a custom domain for your application. This involves updating DNS records to point your domain to your hosting platform.

Most hosting platforms provide detailed instructions for custom domain configuration, including SSL certificate provisioning for secure HTTPS access. Ensure that your domain is properly configured with SSL certificates before directing users to your application.

Update your backend CORS configuration to include your custom domain in the allowed origins list once your domain is active.

## Backend Deployment

The Python FastAPI backend can be deployed to various platforms depending on your scalability requirements, budget constraints, and operational preferences.

### Container-Based Deployment

Containerizing your backend application provides consistency across development and production environments while enabling deployment to any container orchestration platform.

Create a `Dockerfile` in your backend directory:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

Build your container image using `docker build -t aura-backend .` and test it locally to ensure it works correctly with your configuration.

**Docker Compose for Local Testing**: Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to test your containerized application locally:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  backend:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL}
      - SUPABASE_URL=${SUPABASE_URL}
      - SUPABASE_KEY=${SUPABASE_KEY}
    env_file:
      - .env
```

### Platform-as-a-Service Deployment

Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) providers offer simplified deployment processes that handle infrastructure management while allowing you to focus on your application code.

**Heroku Deployment**: Heroku provides an excellent platform for Python applications with minimal configuration required. Create a `Procfile` in your backend directory:

```
web: uvicorn main:app --host=0.0.0.0 --port=${PORT:-8000}
```

Install the Heroku CLI and create a new Heroku application. Configure environment variables using the Heroku dashboard or CLI, then deploy your application using Git.

Heroku automatically detects Python applications and installs dependencies from your `requirements.txt` file during the build process.

**Railway Deployment**: Railway offers modern deployment infrastructure with excellent developer experience. Connect your repository to Railway, and it will automatically detect your Python application and configure appropriate build settings.

Configure environment variables in the Railway dashboard, ensuring all required configuration values are set for your production environment.

### Serverless Deployment

For applications with variable traffic patterns, serverless deployment can provide cost-effective scaling and reduced operational overhead.

**AWS Lambda with Mangum**: Use the Mangum adapter to deploy your FastAPI application to AWS Lambda. Install Mangum as a dependency and create a Lambda handler:

```python
from mangum import Mangum
from main import app

handler = Mangum(app)
```

Deploy using AWS SAM, Serverless Framework, or AWS CDK depending on your infrastructure-as-code preferences.

**Google Cloud Run**: Google Cloud Run provides serverless container deployment that automatically scales based on traffic. Build your container image and deploy it to Cloud Run, configuring environment variables through the Cloud Console.

## Database and Supabase Configuration

Since Aura uses Supabase for database hosting and authentication, production deployment primarily involves configuring your Supabase project for production use and ensuring proper security settings.

### Production Supabase Setup

If you've been using a development Supabase project, create a new project specifically for production use. This separation ensures that development activities don't impact your production users and allows for different security and scaling configurations.

Execute your database schema in the new production project using the SQL editor, ensuring that all tables, indexes, and row-level security policies are properly configured.

### Authentication Configuration

Configure Supabase authentication settings for production use, including email templates, redirect URLs, and security policies. Update allowed redirect URLs to include your production frontend domain.

Review and configure rate limiting settings to prevent abuse while ensuring legitimate users can access your application without restrictions.

### Database Security

Ensure that row-level security policies are properly configured and tested to prevent unauthorized data access. Each user should only be able to access their own data, and the policies should be comprehensive enough to cover all possible access patterns.

Review database access logs periodically to identify any unusual access patterns or potential security issues.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

Production deployments require ongoing monitoring and maintenance to ensure optimal performance and reliability.

### Application Monitoring

Implement comprehensive monitoring for both your frontend and backend applications. This includes error tracking, performance monitoring, and user analytics to understand how your application is being used.

For the backend, consider implementing structured logging that can be easily parsed and analyzed. Include request IDs in logs to trace requests across different components of your system.

### Database Monitoring

Monitor database performance including query execution times, connection pool usage, and storage utilization. Supabase provides built-in monitoring tools, but you may want to implement additional monitoring for application-specific metrics.

Set up alerts for critical issues such as high error rates, slow query performance, or unusual traffic patterns that might indicate problems or security issues.

### Backup and Recovery

While Supabase handles database backups automatically, ensure you understand the backup retention policies and recovery procedures. Consider implementing additional backup strategies for critical data if your business requirements demand it.

Test your recovery procedures periodically to ensure you can restore service quickly in the event of a problem.

### Security Updates

Establish a process for regularly updating dependencies and applying security patches. This includes both your application dependencies and any infrastructure components you manage directly.

Monitor security advisories for the technologies you use and have a plan for quickly applying critical security updates when they become available.

### Performance Optimization

Monitor application performance over time and optimize as needed. This might include database query optimization, caching implementation, or infrastructure scaling as your user base grows.

Consider implementing a content delivery network (CDN) for your frontend assets to improve loading times for users around the world.

This deployment guide provides a comprehensive foundation for moving your Aura Asset Manager application from development to production. Remember that deployment is an iterative process, and you should continuously monitor and improve your deployment based on real-world usage patterns and performance requirements.
