# Aura: Your Personal Financial Sanctuary

Aura is a revolutionary personal asset management platform designed to foster a profound sense of financial security, personal accomplishment, and peace of mind. Unlike traditional financial apps that focus on complex metrics, budgeting, and market volatility, Aura's core mission is to help users visualize, appreciate, and feel secure about the financial foundation they are steadily building for themselves and their loved ones.

## Project Structure

- `frontend/`: Contains the React.js application built with Next.js.
- `backend/`: Contains the Python backend application built with FastAPI.
- `database/`: Contains SQL scripts and instructions for setting up the PostgreSQL database.
- `docs/`: Contains comprehensive documentation, including user guides, deployment guides, and design specifications.
