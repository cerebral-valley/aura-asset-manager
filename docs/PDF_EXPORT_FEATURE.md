### For Developers

#### Adding PDF Export to Other Pages

```javascript
import { exportAssetsToPDF } from '../utils/pdfExport'

const handleExportToPDF = async () => {
  try {
    const pdfData = {
      userName: 'User Name',
      assets: assetsArray,
      aggregateByType: aggregatedData,
      totals: { totalAcquisitionValue, totalPresentValue },
      detailedAssetBreakdown: detailedData,
      currency: 'USD',
      formatCurrency: currencyFormatter,
      formatDate: dateFormatter
    }
    
    await exportAssetsToPDF(pdfData)
    toast.success('PDF generated successfully!')
  } catch (error) {
    toast.error('Failed to generate PDF')
  }
}
```

#### Customizing PDF Content

The PDF template can be customized by modifying the `generatePDFContent` function in `/frontend/src/utils/pdfExport.js`:

- **Styling**: Modify inline CSS styles
- **Layout**: Change HTML structure
- **Content**: Add/remove sections
- **Branding**: Update header content

## Technical Details

### PDF Generation Process

1. **Data Preparation**: Collect all necessary data from the Assets page
2. **HTML Generation**: Create a styled HTML template with the data
3. **DOM Manipulation**: Temporarily add HTML to DOM for rendering
4. **Canvas Conversion**: Use html2canvas to convert HTML to image
5. **PDF Creation**: Use jsPDF to create PDF from the canvas image
6. **Multi-page Handling**: Automatically split content across multiple pages if needed
7. **File Download**: Save PDF with formatted filename

### Performance Considerations

- **Large Datasets**: The system handles large asset lists by using pagination in PDF
- **Memory Usage**: Temporary DOM elements are cleaned up after PDF generation
- **Image Quality**: Uses high-scale factor (2x) for crisp text and graphics
- **Loading States**: Provides visual feedback during generation process

### Error Handling

- **Network Errors**: Graceful handling if user settings can't be fetched
- **Permission Errors**: Browser download permission issues are caught
- **Memory Errors**: Large dataset handling with error recovery
- **User Feedback**: Toast notifications for success/error states

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **PDF Not Downloading**
   - Check browser download permissions
   - Ensure popup blockers are disabled
   - Try with a smaller dataset

2. **Content Cut Off**
   - The system automatically handles multi-page content
   - Very wide tables might need browser zoom adjustment

3. **Missing User Name**
   - Ensure user has filled in First Name and Last Name in User Settings
   - Default fallback: "Asset Portfolio Holder"

4. **Styling Issues**
   - PDF uses inline CSS to ensure consistent rendering
   - Dark mode settings don't affect PDF (always white background)

### Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome**: Full support
- **Firefox**: Full support
- **Safari**: Full support
- **Edge**: Full support
- **Mobile Browsers**: Limited support for large PDFs

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Custom Templates**: Allow users to choose different PDF templates
2. **Export Options**: Additional formats (Excel, CSV)
3. **Scheduling**: Automated report generation and email delivery
4. **Charts**: Include portfolio charts in PDF
5. **Filtering**: Option to export filtered/selected assets only
6. **Internationalization**: Support for different languages and date formats

## Security Considerations

- **Data Privacy**: PDF generation happens client-side (no data sent to external services)
- **User Data**: Only includes data the user already has access to
- **File Storage**: PDFs are not stored on server (downloaded directly)
- **Permissions**: Respects existing user authentication and authorization

## Testing
