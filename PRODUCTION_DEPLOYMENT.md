# ðŸš€ Aura Asset Manager - Complete Production Deployment Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Deployment Strategy

For a secure financial application like Aura, here's the **ideal deployment architecture**:

### **Production Stack**
- **Frontend**: Vercel (automatic HTTPS, global CDN, excellent security)
- **Backend**: Railway (easy Python deployment, automatic scaling)
- **Database**: Supabase (managed PostgreSQL with built-in auth)
- **Monitoring**: Sentry (error tracking), Uptime monitoring

### **Why This Stack?**
âœ… **Security First**: All platforms provide enterprise-grade security  
âœ… **HTTPS by Default**: Automatic SSL certificates  
âœ… **Scalability**: Auto-scaling based on traffic  
âœ… **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime guarantees  
âœ… **Cost Effective**: Pay-as-you-grow pricing  

## ðŸ“‹ Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Prepare Production Environment

1. **Create Production Supabase Project**
   ```bash
   # Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
   # Create new project for production
   # Note down: Project URL, Anon Key, Service Role Key
   ```

2. **Set Up Database Schema**
   ```sql
   -- In Supabase SQL Editor, run your schema.sql
   -- Test Row Level Security policies
   -- Verify authentication works
   ```

3. **Generate Secure Keys**
   ```bash
   # Generate JWT secret key
   openssl rand -hex 32
   
   # Save this securely - you'll need it for backend env vars
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy Backend to Railway

1. **Prepare Backend**
   ```bash
   # In backend directory
   cd backend
   
   # Make sure all dependencies are in requirements.txt
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Deploy to Railway**
   - Go to https://railway.app
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Select `backend` folder as root directory
   - Add environment variables:

   ```bash
   # Essential Environment Variables
   DATABASE_URL=your-supabase-postgres-url
   SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_KEY=your-anon-key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-role-key
   SECRET_KEY=your-32-character-secret-key
   ENVIRONMENT=production
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=["https://yourdomain.com"]
   ```

3. **Test Backend Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Your Railway URL will be something like:
   # https://your-app.railway.app
   
   # Test health endpoint
   curl https://your-app.railway.app/health
   ```

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend to Vercel

1. **Prepare Frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   
   # Create production environment file
   cp .env.production.example .env.production.local
   
   # Update with your actual values:
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-app.railway.app
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Go to https://vercel.com
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Select `frontend` folder as root directory
   - Add environment variables from your .env.production.local
   - Deploy!

3. **Configure Custom Domain**
   ```bash
   # In Vercel dashboard:
   # 1. Go to Project Settings > Domains
   # 2. Add your custom domain (e.g., aura.yourdomain.com)
   # 3. Update DNS records as instructed
   # 4. Wait for SSL certificate to be issued
   ```

### Step 4: Final Security Configuration

1. **Update Backend CORS**
   ```bash
   # In Railway, update ALLOWED_ORIGINS environment variable:
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=["https://yourdomain.com","https://www.yourdomain.com"]
   ```

2. **Configure Supabase Auth**
   ```bash
   # In Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Settings:
   # - Add your domain to "Redirect URLs"
   # - Configure email templates
   # - Set up proper OAuth redirects
   ```

3. **Test Complete Flow**
   - Visit your website
   - Create test account
   - Add sample asset
   - Verify all functionality works

## ðŸ”’ Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Security
- [ ] Generated strong SECRET_KEY (32+ characters)
- [ ] Configured Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase
- [ ] Set CORS origins to production domain only
- [ ] Removed all development/test data
- [ ] Configured HTTPS redirect
- [ ] Set up proper authentication flow

### Post-Deployment Security
- [ ] SSL certificates are active (check with SSL Labs)
- [ ] All API endpoints require authentication
- [ ] RLS policies tested and working
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Backup procedures in place
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring Setup

### 1. Error Tracking with Sentry
```bash
# Add to both frontend and backend
npm install @sentry/react @sentry/tracing  # Frontend
pip install sentry-sdk[fastapi]           # Backend

# Configure in environment variables
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=your-frontend-sentry-dsn
SENTRY_DSN=your-backend-sentry-dsn
```

### 2. Uptime Monitoring
- Use UptimeRobot or similar to monitor your endpoints
- Monitor both frontend (yourdomain.com) and backend API
- Set up alerts for downtime

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- Vercel Analytics for frontend performance
- Railway metrics for backend performance
- Supabase dashboard for database performance

## ðŸ’° Cost Estimation

### Monthly Costs (USD)
- **Vercel Pro**: $20/month (includes custom domain, analytics)
- **Railway**: $5-20/month (based on usage)
